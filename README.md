# ML_CHALLENGE

## About the Take Home Assignment:
The aim of the Take Home Assisnment is to check your understanding of AI-ML concepts, and consists of two simple questions. 
For each question you are expected to do the following:
1) Preprocess the data.
2) Analyse the data (Explain your understanding / observations)
3) Create a model and justify the results.

## Q1
Download the Amazon Fine Food Reviews Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews?select=Reviews.csv) and build a model to predict the sentiment of the review.

You must start with basic EDA and pre-processing (Explain each step of the model building process).

## Q2
Download the Flower Classification Dataset ("https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz") and build a model to predict the flower.

You should also show the following: 
1) Display 4 samples of each type of flower 
2) Convert images to grayscale and test the model.
3) Resize the images.

You must start with basic EDA and pre-processing (Explain each step of the model building process).
